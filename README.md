9/15/22 - I am working on getting it to look much more like the original. I know I had a different style of burger and small screen menu. I am also working on getting the drop down menus to appear. <br>
9/16/22 - Got the main content laid out. Going to spend time doing the actual layout on monday before focusing on styling. <br>
