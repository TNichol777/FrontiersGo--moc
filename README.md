9/15/22 - I am working on getting it to look much more like the original. I know I had a different style of burger and small screen menu. I am also working on getting the drop down menus to appear. <br>
9/16/22 - Got the main content laid out. Going to spend time doing the actual layout on monday before focusing on styling. <br>
9/19/22 - Got the full outline with some of the major styling. Accordion function doesnt work with the given JS at the moment. Also having issues with the image right next to it. Footer and additional styling later <br>
9/20/22 - Updated styling such as margins for main content, top section background image and responsiveness of overlay text. Accordion image is not cooperating and the rest of the main content styling will continue later. <br>
9/21/22 - Accordion about 85% done. Updated some of the main content styling. Need to work on the pictures being the same width & height. Then footer last <br>
9/23/22 - Accordion styling has some issues with it. Footer as of right now is a template so I dont quiet understand everything yet. Will be going back in to recreate it on my own.
